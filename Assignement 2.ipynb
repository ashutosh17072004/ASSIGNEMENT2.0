    "Python Variable is containers that store values. Python is not “statically typed”. We do not need to declare variables before using them or declare their type. A variable is created the moment we first assign a value to it. A Python variable is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program\n",
    "Rules for Python variables\n",
    "(1) A Python variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.\n",
    "(2) A Python variable name cannot start with a number.\n",
    "(3) A Python variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).\n",
    "(3) Variable in Python names are case-sensitive (name, Name, and NAME are three different variables).\n",
    "(4) The reserved words(keywords) in Python cannot be used to name the variable in Python."
